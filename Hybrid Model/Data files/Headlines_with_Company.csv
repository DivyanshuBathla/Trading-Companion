Anindya had joined in 2021 from Lotte (Havmor Ice creams) 

Before this, Sudip Ghose had resigned in 2021 after being at the top for just 3 years. 

Wonder what it is that has these guys ‚Äúpacking their bags‚Äù so often. 

VIP has appointed Neetu Kashiramka (Ex Jyothy Labs) as the MD Designate. 
She‚Äôs the CFO currently, was only recently appointed. 

Such management churn in family owned companies is usually not viewed favorably by investors & shareholders. 

This explains the underperformance of the stock vs peers like Safari and other travel related stocks in the recent past.
