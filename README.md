The stock market, characterized by its dynamic nature, is subject to various influencing factors including public sentiment, government policies, geopolitical events, among others. This complexity often poses challenges for investors seeking to make informed decisions regarding resource allocation. In response to this challenge, a comprehensive study has been undertaken, leveraging sentiment analysis on stock-specific news and public perceptions along with statistical analysis to forecast future price movements.

To address this objective, a multi-layer neural network is renowned for its efficiency in capturing intricate patterns and relationships within extensive datasets, alongside an empirical scoring mechanism. Furthermore, recognizing the value of historical market data and established trading patterns, the study extends its analytical framework to incorporate statistical methodologies. Specifically, candlestick patterns, a staple in technical analysis, are employed to discern subtle shifts and trends in market sentiment and investor behavior.

Experimental findings indicate that the sentiment analysis model achieves an accuracy rate of 68% and statistical analysis achieved a remarkable accuracy of 70%. These results underscore the efficacy of the proposed approach in aiding investors to navigate the complexities of the stock market with greater precision and confidence.
